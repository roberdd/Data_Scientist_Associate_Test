## Introduction:
Company Background
EMO is a manufacturer of motorcycles. The company successfully launched its first electric moped in India in 2019. The product team knows how valuable owner reviews are in making improvements to their mopeds.

Unfortunately they often get reviews from people who never owned the moped. They donâ€™t want to consider this feedback, so would like to find a way to identify reviews from these people. They have obtained data from other mopeds, where they know if the reviewer owned the moped or not. They think this is equivalent to their own reviews.

- **The main goal is to predict which reviews come from people who have never owned the moped before.**

## Data Validation
- Load data
- Transform the data with the given criteria
- Validate the data
- Report results

## Exploratory Analysis
- Create at least 2 graphs using a single column
- Create at least 1 graph using more columns
- Use the graphs to describe the findings

## Model Fitting
- Describe the problem and choose the Machine Learning Algorithm to implement
- Choose a baseline machine learning model and a comparison machine learning model to solve the problem
- Train both machine learning models

## Model Evaluation
- Select the main metric to evaluate performance of both models
- Use metrics to report results
